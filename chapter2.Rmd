## **RStudio Exercise 2: Regression and Model Validation**

I have completed the data wrangling exercises: I've read the data from the file with the help of *read.table* function, 


```{r}

create_learning2014 <- read.table("http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

dim(create_learning2014)

str(create_learning2014)



```
